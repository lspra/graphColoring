  abstract  = "Computational methods are rapidly becoming major tools of theoretical, pharmaceutical, materials, and biological chemists. Accordingly, the mathematical models and numerical analysis that underlie these methods have an increasingly important and direct role to play in the progress of many areas of chemistry. This book explores the research interface between computational chemistry and the mathematical sciences. In language that is aimed at non-specialists, it documents some prominent examples of past successful cross-fertilizations between the fields and explores the mathematical research opportunities in a broad cross-section of chemical research frontiers. It also discusses cultural differences between the two fields and makes recommendations for overcoming those differences and generally promoting this interdisciplinary work.",

abstract = {The purpose of the present chapter is to bind together and extend some recent developments regarding data-driven nonsmooth regularization techniques in image processing through the means of a bilevel minimization scheme. The scheme, considered in function space, takes advantage of a dualization framework and it is designed to produce spatially varying regularization parameters adapted to the data for well-known regularizers, e.g., total variation and total generalized variation, leading to automated (monolithic), image reconstruction workflows. An inclusion of the theory of bilevel optimization and the theoretical background of the dualization framework, as well as a brief review of the aforementioned regularizers and their parameterization, makes this chapter a self-contained one. Aspects of the numerical implementation of the scheme are discussed and numerical examples are provided.}
